## Train a Support Vector Machine Classifier

inds = not (str(species) == str('setosa'))
# Ignore all the 0s, get all the 1s from inds for what we want from meas,
# and columns 3 to 4 for meas.
X = meas(inds,np.arange(3,4+1))
# Same here except just need everything not setosa

# The Command Window shows that |SVMModel| is a trained |ClassificationSVM|
# classifier and a property list.  Display the
# properties of |SVMModel|, for example, to determine the class order, by using
# dot notation.
classOrder = SVMModel.ClassNames
##
# The first class (|'versicolor'|) is the negative class, and the second
# (|'virginica'|) is the positive class.  You can change the class order
# during training by using the |'ClassNames'| name-value pair argument.

# Plot a scatter diagram of the data and circle the support vectors.
sv = SVMModel.SupportVectors

##
# The support vectors are observations that occur on or beyond their
# estimated class boundaries.
##
# You can adjust the boundaries (and therefore the number of support
# vectors) by setting a box constraint during training using the
# |'BoxConstraint'| name-value pair argument.
